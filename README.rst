This is a simple yet fun project i made just to pass time.
I love lissening to a lot of radios from the website https://www.xatworld.com/radio-search/ . it's just awesome the number of genres and radios you can find in that place
but since i have a little eeepc, it would take me sometime to get all of my favourite radios ip's just to play on mplayer since openning firefox requires some extra efforts.
Beeing a linux fan and a fanatic for linux terminal i came with this idea of creating a little program to get all the genres of that website and display all radios of that genre.
It was a challenging project but i enjoy it to the max!

I hope you enjoy this program and be free to mess around with it :)
