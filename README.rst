Hello Everyone!!!
This is my first project ever on git and I hope you all enjoy it :)

This is a simple yet fun project I made just to pass the time.
I love listening to a lot of radios from the website https://www.xatworld.com/radio-search/. it's just awesome how much genres of music i didn't knew existed. Since I have a little eeepc, it would take me some time to get all of my favourite radios ips just to play them on mplayer since opening Firefox requires some extra efforts.
Being a Linux fan and a fanatic for Linux terminal I came with this idea of creating a little program to get all the genres of that website and display all radios of that genre.
It was a challenging project but i enjoy it to the max!

I hope you enjoy this program and be free to mess around with it :)

To run this program all you have to do is:
If you're on Linux -> Run ./radio.sh
If you're on windows -> Type python main.py
If you're on a mac -> forgive me if it gives you some errors, don't have a mac
